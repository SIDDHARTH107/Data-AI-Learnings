        "Q1: A t-test and a z-test are both statistical tests used to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data. The main difference between the two is the assumptions made about the population variance. A z-test assumes that the population variance is known, while a t-test assumes that the population variance is unknown and estimates it based on the sample variance.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if a researcher wants to test if the average height of a sample of students is significantly different from the population average height, and the population variance is known, they would use a z-test. On the other hand, if the population variance is unknown, they would use a t-test.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2: In hypothesis testing, a one-tailed test is a statistical test where the alternative hypothesis is one-sided, while a two-tailed test is a statistical test where the alternative hypothesis is two-sided. In other words, a one-tailed test checks if the sample mean is significantly greater than or less than a certain value, while a two-tailed test checks if the sample mean is significantly different from a certain value.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if a researcher wants to test if a new medication increases or decreases the average heart rate, they would use a one-tailed test. However, if the researcher wants to test if the new medication has any effect on the heart rate, they would use a two-tailed test.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3: Type 1 error occurs when a null hypothesis is rejected even though it is true. This means that the researcher concludes that there is a significant effect or relationship between the variables when there is not. Type 2 error occurs when a null hypothesis is not rejected even though it is false. This means that the researcher concludes that there is no significant effect or relationship between the variables when there is.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if a researcher tests if a new medication is effective, a type 1 error would occur if they conclude that the medication is effective when it is not, while a type 2 error would occur if they conclude that the medication is not effective when it is.\n",

        "Q4: Bayes's theorem is a mathematical formula used to calculate the probability of an event occurring given prior knowledge of the event's probability and new evidence.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, let's say that a company produces a certain type of product, and 5% of the products are defective. A customer purchases a product and finds that it is defective. Using Bayes's theorem, the company can calculate the probability that a product is defective given that a customer has found it to be defective.\n",

        "Q5: A confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter with a certain degree of confidence. It is calculated based on sample data and the margin of error.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if a researcher wants to estimate the average height of a population, they can take a sample of heights and calculate a confidence interval around the sample mean. A 95% confidence interval means that if the researcher were to take many samples and calculate their confidence intervals, 95% of them would contain the true population mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula used to calculate the probability of an event occurring based on prior knowledge and new evidence. The formula is:\n",
        "\n",
        "P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)\n",
        "\n",
        "where P(A|B) is the probability of A occurring given that B has occurred, P(B|A) is the probability of B occurring given that A has occurred, P(A) is the prior probability of A occurring, and P(B) is the prior probability of B occurring.\n",

        "Example problem:\n",
        "Suppose a medical test for a certain disease is known to have a false positive rate of 5% and a false negative rate of 1%. If the prevalence of the disease in the population is 2%, what is the probability that a person who tests positive actually has the disease?\n",
        "\n",
        "Solution:\n",
        "Let A represent having the disease and B represent testing positive. Then, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of A given B:\n",
        "\n",
        "P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)\n",
        "\n",
        "We know that P(B|A) is the probability of testing positive given that the person has the disease, which is the true positive rate, or 1 - false negative rate = 0.99. We also know that P(A) is the prevalence of the disease in the population, which is 0.02.\n",
        "\n",
        "To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:\n",
        "P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)\n",
        "where P(B|not A) is the false positive rate, or 0.05, and P(not A) is 1 - P(A), or 0.98.\n",
        "\n",
        "P(B) = 0.99 * 0.02 + 0.05 * 0.98 = 0.0546\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, we can substitute all values into the Bayes' theorem formula:\n",
        "P(A|B) = 0.99 * 0.02 / 0.0546 = 0.362\n",
        "So the probability that a person who tests positive actually has the disease is 0.362, or 36.2%.\n",

        "Q7. A confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter with a certain level of confidence. To calculate a 95% confidence interval for a sample of data with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 5, we can use the formula:\n",
        "\n",
        "CI = X̄ ± Z* (σ/√n)\n",
        "\n",
        "where X̄ is the sample mean, Z is the z-score associated with the confidence level (in this case, 1.96 for a 95% confidence level), σ is the population standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n",

        "Plugging in the values, we get:\n",
        "\n",
        "CI = 50 ± 1.96 * (5/√50) = (47.16, 52.84)\n",

        "Q8. The margin of error in a confidence interval is the amount of error we allow for in our estimate of the true population parameter. It represents the range of values above and below the sample estimate within which we can expect the true population parameter to lie with a certain level of confidence.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sample size affects the margin of error because as the sample size increases, the standard error of the mean decreases, leading to a smaller margin of error. In other words, a larger sample size leads to a more precise estimate of the true population parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9. The z-score for a data point with a value of 75, a population mean of 70, and a population standard deviation of 5 can be calculated using the formula:\n",
        "\n",
        "z = (x - μ) / σ\n",

        "z = (75 - 70) / 5\n",
        "z = 1\n",
        "\n",
        "Interpretation: The z-score of 1 indicates that the data point of 75 is one standard deviation above the population mean.\n",

        "Q10. To conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the weight loss drug is significantly effective at a 95% confidence level using a t-test, we need to set up the null and alternative hypotheses:\n",

        "t = (6 - 0) / (2.5 / √50)\n",
        "t = 12\n",
        "\n",
        "Using a t-distribution table with 49 degrees of freedom (df = n - 1), we find that the critical t-value for a two-tailed test at a 95% confidence level is ±2.009.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since our calculated t-value of 12 is greater than the critical t-value of 2.009, we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the weight loss drug is significantly effective at a 95% confidence level.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interpretation: The results of the study suggest that the new weight loss drug has a statistically significant effect on weight loss, as the mean weight loss of 6 pounds is significantly different from zero.\n",

        "Q13. To calculate the 90% confidence interval for the true population mean, we can use the formula:\n",
        "\n",
        "CI = x̄ ± Zα/2 * σ/√n\n",
        "\n",
        "where x̄ is the sample mean, σ is the population standard deviation, n is the sample size, Zα/2 is the critical value from the standard normal distribution corresponding to a 90% confidence level (which is 1.645).\n",
