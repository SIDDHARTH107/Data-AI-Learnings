        "\n",
        "Gather the data. You will need to collect data on the amount of time each student spent studying for the exam and their final exam score.\n",
        "Calculate the mean and standard deviation for each variable. The mean is the average value for a set of data, and the standard deviation is a measure of how spread out the data is.\n",
        "Calculate the covariance. The covariance is a measure of how much two variables vary together.\n",
        "Divide the covariance by the product of the standard deviations. This will give you the Pearson correlation coefficient.\n",
        "The Pearson correlation coefficient can range from -1 to 1. A value of 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation, meaning that as one variable increases, the other variable also increases. A value of -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, meaning that as one variable increases, the other variable decreases. A value of 0 indicates no correlation, meaning that there is no relationship between the two variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "In your example, the Pearson correlation coefficient between the amount of time students spend studying for an exam and their final exam scores is 0.75. This indicates a strong positive correlation, meaning that as the amount of time students spend studying increases, their final exam scores also tend to increase.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is important to note that a correlation coefficient does not imply causation. Just because two variables are correlated does not mean that one variable causes the other. In your example, the correlation between the amount of time students spend studying and their final exam scores does not mean that studying causes students to do better on exams. There could be other factors, such as intelligence or motivation, that are also contributing to the correlation.\n",

        "Rank the data. Rank the amount of sleep each individual gets each night and their overall job satisfaction level on a scale of 1 to 10.\n",

        "In this example, the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between the amount of sleep individuals get each night and their overall job satisfaction level on a scale of 1 to 10 is 0.85. This indicates a strong positive correlation, meaning that as the amount of sleep individuals get increases, their overall job satisfaction level also tends to increase.\n",

        "It is important to note that a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient does not imply causation. Just because two variables are correlated does not mean that one variable causes the other. In your example, the correlation between the amount of sleep individuals get and their overall job satisfaction level does not mean that getting more sleep causes individuals to be more satisfied with their jobs. There could be other factors, such as personality or work environment, that are also contributing to the correlation.\n",

This indicates a moderate negative correlation, meaning that as the number of hours of exercise per week increases, BMI tends to decrease.

This is very close to the Pearson correlation coefficient, which suggests that the relationship between these two variables is linear.\n",
