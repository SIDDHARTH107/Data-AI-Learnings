        "\n",
        "Bernoulli Naive Bayes and Multinomial Naive Bayes are both types of Naive Bayes classifiers. However, they differ in the way that they handle the features.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bernoulli Naive Bayes is used for classification problems where the features are binary. This means that each feature can only take on two values, such as \"true\" or \"false\". For example, a Bernoulli Naive Bayes classifier could be used to classify whether or not an email is spam, where the features are the presence or absence of certain keywords in the email.\n",
        "\n",
        "Multinomial Naive Bayes is used for classification problems where the features are categorical. This means that each feature can take on multiple values, such as the genre of a movie. For example, a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier could be used to classify movies into different genres, where the features are the words that appear in the movie's title.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3. How does Bernoulli Naive Bayes handle missing values?\n",
        "\n",
        "Bernoulli Naive Bayes handles missing values by assuming that the missing value is equal to the prior probability of the feature. For example, if the prior probability of a feature being \"true\" is 50%, then a missing value for that feature will be treated as if it were \"true\" with probability 50% and \"false\" with probability 50%.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4. Can Gaussian Naive Bayes be used for multi-class classification?\n",
        "\n",
        "Yes, Gaussian Naive Bayes can be used for multi-class classification. However, it is not as efficient as other methods for multi-class classification, such as support vector machines or decision trees.\n",
        "\n",
        "Gaussian Naive Bayes assumes that the features are normally distributed. This means that the features are distributed in a bell-shaped curve. If the features are not normally distributed, then Gaussian Naive Bayes may not be accurate.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition, Gaussian Naive Bayes requires that the features be independent. This means that the features cannot affect each other. If the features are not independent, then Gaussian Naive Bayes may not be accurate.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite these limitations, Gaussian Naive Bayes can be a useful tool for multi-class classification. It is relatively simple to implement and it can be efficient for small datasets."
