        "\n",
        "Polynomial functions and kernel functions are both used in machine learning algorithms to map data from a lower-dimensional space to a higher-dimensional space. This mapping allows algorithms to learn more complex relationships between the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "A polynomial function is a mathematical function that takes a number of inputs and returns a number. The simplest polynomial function is the linear function, which takes two inputs and returns a line. More complex polynomial functions can take more inputs and return more complex curves.\n",
        "\n",
        "A kernel function is a mathematical function that takes two inputs and returns a number. Kernel functions are often used in machine learning algorithms to calculate the similarity between two data points. The most common kernel function is the radial basis function (RBF) kernel.\n",
        "\n",
        "The relationship between polynomial functions and kernel functions is that a polynomial function can be used to define a kernel function. For example, the RBF kernel can be defined as a polynomial function of the Euclidean distance between two data points.\n",

        "This code will load the data from a file called data.csv. The data file should have two columns, where the first column contains the features and the second column contains the labels. The code will then split the data into training and testing sets, create an instance of the SVC classifier, and train the classifier on the training data. The code will then predict the labels of the testing data and evaluate the performance of the classifier.\n",

        "\n",
        "In SVR, the epsilon parameter controls the number of support vectors. A higher value of epsilon will result in fewer support vectors. This is because a higher value of epsilon allows the decision boundary to be more flexible, which means that fewer data points will be classified as support vectors.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, consider a simple dataset with two classes. If the epsilon parameter is set to a low value, then the decision boundary will be very close to the data points. This will result in a large number of support vectors. However, if the epsilon parameter is set to a high value, then the decision boundary will be more flexible and will not be as close to the data points. This will result in a smaller number of support vectors.\n",
        "\n",
        "In general, a higher value of epsilon will result in a better generalization performance. This is because a more flexible decision boundary is less likely to overfit the training data. However, a higher value of epsilon may also result in a lower accuracy on the training data.\n",

        "Q4. How does the choice of kernel function, C parameter, epsilon parameter, and gamma parameter affect the performance of Support Vector Regression (SVR)? Can you explain how each parameter works and provide examples of when you might want to increase or decrease its value?\n",
        "\n",
        "The kernel function, C parameter, epsilon parameter, and gamma parameter all affect the performance of SVR.\n",
        "\n",
        "The kernel function defines the similarity between two data points. The most common kernel functions are the linear kernel, the polynomial kernel, and the RBF kernel. The linear kernel is the simplest kernel function and is only suitable for linear problems. The polynomial kernel can be used for non-linear problems, but it can be sensitive to noise. The RBF kernel is a more general kernel function that can be used for a wider range of problems.\n",
        "The C parameter controls the trade-off between the training error and the complexity of the model. A higher value of C will result in a more complex model with a lower training error. However, a higher value of C may also"
